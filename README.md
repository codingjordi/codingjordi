My name is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordi-saperas-castro/">Jordi</a>, and I’m a passionate and dedicated Front-End developer with a focus on React and UX/UI. On my daily basis, I make it a priority to practice and sharpen the skills I’ve already acquired in various technologies. My guiding principle is to write clean code that remains both maintainable, scalable and efficient. 

<br>
JavaScript is, <del>and always will be</del>, my favorite programming language because of its versatility. It empowers me to build dynamic and interactive user interfaces, as well as backend services, all with one powerful language. I call it "the 3-in-1" for developers 🏆
